Details for AI Pathfinding

The pathfinding within this game works by finding the shortest path from the enemies to
a specified location. This location is determined by many different factors and states
in the game.

6 objects in each room have been set up to raycast from their position to the user, to see
what areas in the room can see the user without being blocked by obstacles. This allows
the enemy to determine where to move, depending if they want to shoot the enemy, in which
case they will move near to a node that can see the user, or if they want to find cover, in
which case they will move to a node that cannot see the user. If there are multiple nodes
available, one will be chose at random to keep the enemies moving around. All of this 
functionality is shown in the Pathfinding AI file and the States file.
